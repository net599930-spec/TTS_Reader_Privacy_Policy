**Last updated: February 8, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Simple EPUB TTS application (“the App”) handles user data.

The App is designed to operate fully offline and does **not collect, store, or share personal information.**

---

## File Access

The App requests permission to access files on the device solely to allow EPUB books selected by the user to be imported.

Specifically:

- File access is used only to select and open EPUB files chosen by the user.
- Imported books remain stored locally on the device.
- Files are never uploaded, transmitted, or backed up to external servers.

---

## How the App Works

After an EPUB file is imported, the App provides the ability to:

- Read books within the App  
- Listen to books using the device’s built-in Text-to-Speech engine  
- Adjust voices, languages, and speaking speed through device settings  
- Customize reading themes  
- Search within book content  

All functionality operates locally on the device.

## Text-to-Speech

Text-to-Speech functionality is provided by the operating system’s built-in Text-to-Speech service. The App does not transmit book content or text externally.

Voice and language data are managed entirely by the device’s operating system.

---

## Data Collection

The App does **not** collect:

- Personal information  
- Account information  
- Usage analytics  
- Book content  
- Audio recordings  

The App does not include third-party analytics services or advertising SDKs.

## Data Sharing

No user data is shared with third parties.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from any users, including children.

---

## Security

Books, preferences, and settings remain stored locally on the device. No data is transmitted externally by the App.
