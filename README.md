# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 8, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how my EPUB Text-to-Speech Reader app (“the App”) handles your data.

I respect your privacy. The App is designed to work fully offline and does **not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

---

## File Access

The App requests permission to access files on your device only so you can import EPUB books that you choose.

Specifically:

- File access is used solely to let you select and open EPUB files.
- Imported books remain stored locally on your device.
- Your files are never uploaded, transmitted, or backed up to any server.

---

## How the App Works

After importing an EPUB file, the App allows you to:

- Read the book inside the app  
- Listen to the book using your device’s built-in Text-to-Speech engine  
- Change voices, languages, and speaking speed (handled entirely by your device)  
- Adjust reading themes  
- Search within the book  

All features operate locally on your device.

## Text-to-Speech

Text-to-Speech is provided by your operating system’s built-in TTS service. The App does not send any text externally.

Any voices or language data are managed by your device.

---

## Data Collection

I do **not** collect:

- Personal information  
- Account data  
- Usage analytics  
- Book content  
- Audio recordings  

The App does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

---

## Data Sharing

I do not share any data with third parties.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children.

---

## GDPR & CCPA

Because no personal data is collected, stored, or processed, GDPR and CCPA requirements do not apply to this App.

---

## Security

All books and settings stay on your device. Nothing is transmitted externally.

---

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected here with an updated date.
